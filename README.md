Documentation &amp; data for the Library of Congress American Memory Century of Lawmaking collection.

This repository is a community hub for working with the digitized early United States documents in the Library of Congress's American Memory: Century of Lawmaking collection (http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lawhome.html). The documents relate primarily to the United States Congress, but there are other contemporanous documents here.

From the collection:

> A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation consists of a linked set of published congressional records of the United States of America from the Continental Congress through the 43rd Congress, 1774-1875.

A select number of documents and reports from the monumental U.S. Congressional Serial Set are available as well.

Scans of the original documents (TIF/GIF/JPG), metadata (.TXT), and in some cases transcribed text (SGM) are available within each collection at http://memory.loc.gov:8081/ll/. A mirror of those files except for the images is currently also at http://www.govtrack.us/data/misc/am_mem_law_metadata.tgz (187M). (Josh has also mirrored the images in an AWS snapshot.)
