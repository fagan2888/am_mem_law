United States Statutes at Large (LLSL)
======================================

The “United States Statutes at Large” are the official source for laws and resolutions passed by the United States Congress. This collection contains a complete collection of these records from 1789-1875, which were gathered in the eighteen (print) volumes of the Statutes at Large.

The Library of Congress was responsible for scanning and publishing these documents as TIFF (picture) files, along with metadata, as part of its Century of Lawmaking Project in the mid-1990s.

According to the Library, “every law, public and private, ever enacted by the Congress is published in the Statutes at Large in the order of the date of its passage. Until 1948, all treaties and international agreements approved by the Senate were also published in the set. In addition, the Statutes at Large includes the text of the Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation, the Constitution, amendments to the Constitution, treaties with Indians and foreign nations, and presidential proclamations.”

Data Source

The webpages containing the Library of Congress’ digital version of the Statutes at Large can be found here: http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lwsllink.html. The metadata that accompanies webpages can be found here: http://memory.loc.gov:8081/ll/llsl/

Note that the URL of the webpage mirrors the URL of the metadata. For example:

Starting Web page: http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=004/llsl004.db

Metadata: http://memory.loc.gov:8081/ll/llsl/004/llsl004.txt

To get the actual web page of a metadata record, you have to count lines in the metadata. For example: chapter 21 (An Act to Authorize the Laying Out and Opening Certain Public Roads in the Territory of Florida), is available at http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=004/llsl004.db&recNum=52. note the key addition of “&recNum=52”.

The Library of Congress identified 11 metadata fields created for the Statutes at Large. They are:

5. Session of Congress

6. Chamber of Congress

7. Left Column Page Number

Missing Statutes at Large
-------------------------

These documents constitute the first 86 years of the United States’ official laws and resolution, as well as assorted other documents. There is no official electronic source for the Statutes at Large from 1875 until 1951, leaving a 76 year gap.

Recently, the Government Printing Office scanned the Statutes at Large from 1951 to 2009 and made those documents available as searchable PDFs with high quality metadata at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=STATUTE&browsePath=2009&isCollapsed=true&leafLevelBrowse=false&ycord=123. More information about why this was done is available at http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/02/19/gpo-is-closing-gap-on-public-access-to-law-at-jcps-direction-but-much-work-remains/. The most recent years that contain laws passed by Congress and enacted into law are available through THOMAS.gov and Congress.gov as well as available individually on GPO’s FDSYS.gov website.

While there are official print sources that cover the gap years, there are only unofficial electronic sources. The Constitution Society makes available PDFs of these gap years at http://constitution.org/uslaw/sal/sal.htm, which the Sunlight Foundation mirrored at http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/policy/statutes/index.html. They’re also available from the Internet Archive at http://archive.org/search.php?query=united%20states%20statutes%20at%20large.

The Library of Congress maintains a spreadsheet from its Century of Lawmaking project that contains information on all the anomalies in how the Statutes at Large have been published from 1789-2002. A copy of that is available here: http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/policy/statutes/Century%20of%20Lawmaking%20-%20Copy%20of%20Statutes%20at%20Large%20details%204-11-2013.xls
